v 0.47 (7/22/2015)
-----
+ By popular demand, config file nuking has been implemented (restores the game to default)

  >> To use this, double click any empty space within the window to toggle between GPU Info and Debug Utilities, then click the "Delete All Configuration Files" button and confirm that you really wish to do this.

v 0.46 (7/21/2015)
-----
+ INI parser can properly deal with missing INI key/value pairs at save-time
+ Added experimental borderless window fullscreen mode override

 >>  Click the borderless window radio button until it turns into a check box and leave BMT.exe running while you launch BatmanAK.exe to use this feature

v 0.45 (7/19/2015)
-----
+ Disables a few options that could cause the game to go into a sort of sanity check mode
+ Adds a [BMT.User] TweakedBy=<Version> to BmEngine.ini and BmSystemSettings.ini for planned future features

v 0.44 (7/18/2015)
-----
 + Added NVIDIA driver version validation / warning at startup
 + Reports NVIDIA driver *version* now instead of release/branch
 + Increased debug information level on file I/O error

v 0.43 (7/16/2015)
------
+ No longer requires MSVC 2015 Redistributables

v 0.42
------
+ Set PoolSize for the slow profile back to 1024
 >> This profile uses a file cache with a fixed-size and the GART optimization will exceed that size causing the game to crash

v 0.41
------
+ Added icons to important buttons to make the GUI slightly less confusing
+ Added NVIDIA driver version to the GPU Info section
+ Improved efficiency of NVAPI DRS (driver settings) load/store

v 0.40
------
+ Aligns PhysX memory pools to power-of-two
+ Tunes streaming texture memory pool size to match AGP/PCIe GART (System Shared Memory)
+ Scales back Optimized TexGroup settings for AMD compatibility
+ Enables Async Defrag in Balanced streaming profile
+ Decouples DetailMode from "Level of Detail" setting (will add a new option for this later)
+ Corrects issue preventing Level of Detail and Shadow Quality from being set individually
+ Add Disable, 1 and 60 to Visibility options (these settings are for debugging, don't touch them)
