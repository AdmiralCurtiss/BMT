v 0.42
------
+ Set PoolSize for the slow profile back to 1024

+ Added NVIDIA driver version to the GPU Info section
+ Improved efficiency of NVAPI DRS (driver settings) load/store

------
+ Aligns PhysX memory pools to power-of-two
+ Tunes streaming texture memory pool size to match AGP/PCIe GART (System Shared Memory)
+ Scales back Optimized TexGroup settings for AMD compatibility
+ Enables Async Defrag in Balanced streaming profile
+ Decouples DetailMode from "Level of Detail" setting (will add a new option for this later)
+ Corrects issue preventing Level of Detail and Shadow Quality from being set individually
